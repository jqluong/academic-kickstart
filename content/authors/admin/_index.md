I am a fifth year applied mathematics graduate student at UCLA.  I am interested in the mathematics arising from engineering applications. Currently, I focus on compressible fluid dynamics, particularly gas dynamics modelled by the inviscid compressible Euler equations. I previously worked on particle laden flow and control theory for PDEs. Additionally, I am interested in the numerical aspects of such problems. I have done some work with Los Alamos National Laboratory. Last summer I looked at the role of
entropy in numerical calculations of the Euler equations. Currently, I am investigating implosions to the Euler equations via
the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws and numerical simulations.

I completed my undergraduate degree at Fresno State in 2021, studying pure mathematics and mechanical engineering.

Unfortunately, I do not antiicipate participating in UCLA's [Directed Reading Program](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~drp/) this academic year.
