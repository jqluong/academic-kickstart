I am a second year applied mathematics graduate student at UCLA.  I am interested in the mathematics arising from engineering applications, such as control theory, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations.  I have completed all of my required qualifying exams (Basic, Applied Differential Equations, Numerical Analysis).  This summer I was working on the [UCLA CAM REU](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/WORKFORCE/REU2022Topics.html) doing research in particle laden flow, and continuing that research currently.

I completed my undergraduate degree at Fresno State in 2021, studying pure mathematics and mechanical engineering.

Iï»¿ am open to mentoring students through UCLA's [Directed Reading Program](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~drp/).  Past projects I've mentored with students can be found under my teaching tab.  If you're interested in areas I'm interested in or areas I may know something about, I encourage you to apply to the DRP at the beginning of the quarter!
