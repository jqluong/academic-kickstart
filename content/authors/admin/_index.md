I am a third year applied mathematics graduate student at UCLA.  I am interested in the mathematics arising from engineering applications, such as control theory, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations.  I am currently working on projects on particle laden flow and control theory. 
I completed my undergraduate degree at Fresno State in 2021, studying pure mathematics and mechanical engineering.

Iï»¿ am open to mentoring students through UCLA's [Directed Reading Program](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~drp/).  Past projects I've mentored with students can be found under my teaching tab.  I prefer to work with students on topics that aren't directly covered in undergraduate math courses at UCLA.  If you're interested in areas I'm interested in or areas I may know something about, I encourage you to apply to the DRP at the beginning of the quarter! (NOTE: I am not participating in the DRP Fall 2023, check back in Winter 2024.)
