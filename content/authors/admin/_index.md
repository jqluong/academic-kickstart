I am a second year applied mathematics graduate student at UCLA.  I am currently interested in controls, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations.  I have completed 2/3 out of my required qualifying exams (Basic and Applied Differential Equations) thus far.  This summer I am working on the [UCLA CAM REU](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/WORKFORCE/REU2022Topics.html) doing research in particle laden flow.

I completed my undergraduate degree at Fresno State in 2021, studying pure mathematics and mechanical engineering.
