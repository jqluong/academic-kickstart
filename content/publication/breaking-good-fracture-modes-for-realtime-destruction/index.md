abstract: Drawing a direct analogy with the well-studied vibration or elastic
  modes, we introduce an object's fracture modes, which constitute its preferred
  or most natural ways of breaking. We formulate a sparsified eigenvalue
  problem, which we solve iteratively to obtain the $n$ lowest-energy modes.
  These can be precomputed for a given shape to obtain a prefracture pattern
  that can substitute the state of the art for realtime applications at no
  runtime cost but significantly greater realism. Furthermore, any realtime
  impact can be projected onto our modes to obtain impact-dependent fracture
  patterns without the need for any online crack propagation simulation. We not
  only introduce this theoretically novel concept, but also show its fundamental
  and practical superiority in a diverse set of examples and contexts.

summary: We develop an algorithm for computing the fracture modes, or the most
  natural ways for the object to break, of an object.  Once the fracture modes
  are computed, real time impact can be projected onto the object to simulate
  fracture of the object.
