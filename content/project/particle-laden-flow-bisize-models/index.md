  caption: An example of the particles separating from themselves and the fluid

Tï»¿he flow of sediment suspended in a liquid down a slope, although simple sounding, is not well understood mathematically and gives rise to interesting long term behaviors.  I am modelling how a slurry of oil and two different types of particles, of the same density and material but different sizes, develops as it flows down an incline.  We see two prominent long term behaviors the flow exhibits depending on our choice of incline angle and particle concentration compared to fluid, and hope our model is able to accurately capture this bifurcation.
