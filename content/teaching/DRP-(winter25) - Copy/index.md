This project was on learning about the discontinous garlekin method, with a particular application to hyperbolic conservation laws. We began by discussing the relevance of numerical methods that handle discontinuities for the application of hyperbolic conservation laws
and the relavent theory on shocks. We then gave an overview of garlekin methods in general before specifically studying continous and discontinous formulations of the Garlekin method for hypberbolic conservation laws.
We used the following resource:

1. Numerical Methods for Conservation Laws (R. LeVeque): Ch. 1 - 4
2. An Introduction to Element-Based Galerkin Methods on Tensor-Product Bases (F. Giraldo): Ch. 2, 5, 6
