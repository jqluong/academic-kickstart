This project was on introducing the basics of modern control theory on linear systems. We first discussed the basic properties of state-space linear systems. 
Afterwards, we defined controllability and observability of linear systems and went over fundamental results of both such as the controllability and observability matrices and the duality between controllability and observability.
We finished the semester by introducing state feedback and state observers.
We used the following resource:
