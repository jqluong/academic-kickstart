This project was on how to approximate functions using "simpler" functions.  We covered the basic tools of approximation
theory, approxmation by Fourier Series, and approximation by Chebyshev polynomials.  We used the following resources:
1. Approximation Theory - From Taylor Polynomials to Wavelets (O. Christensen and K. Christensen): Ch. 1 - 4
2. Chebyshev Polynomials: From Approximation Theory to Algebra and Number Theory (T. Rivlin): Ch. 1, 3
