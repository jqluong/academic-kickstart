This project was an introduction to nonlinear control theory.  We first introduced the basic principles of nonlinear dynamical systems and then
discussed concepts such as controllability and stabilizability for nonlinear systems specifically.  We used the following resources:

1. Nonlinear Systems (H. Khalil) 
2. Mathematical Control Theory (E. Sontag)
