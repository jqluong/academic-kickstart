This project was on further learning about nonlinear systems and chaos past what is covered in Math 134.  Building on previous knowledge,
we discussed concepts such as the Lorenz system, chaotic dynamical systems, and discrete time system.  In the spring, we introduced fractals and their
basic properties.  We discussed more of the proofs and analytical techniques involved than in Math 134.  We used the following resources:

1. Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos (S. Strogatz): Ch. 9 - 12
2. Fractal Geometry (K. Falconer): Ch. 1 - 3
