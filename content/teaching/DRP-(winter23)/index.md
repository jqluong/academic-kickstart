This project was on undertsanding the Finite Element Method for the purpose of computer graphics.  We covered some
theoretical background of the Finite Element Method as well as some practical considerations when applied to simulating
physical proccesses in computer graphics.  We used the following resources:
1. Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations by the Finite Element Method (C. Johnson): Ch. 1 - 2
2. Polygon Mesh Processing (L. Kobbelt, M. Botsch, and M. Pauly): Appendix
3. Algorithms and Interfaces for Real-Time Deformation of 2D and 3D Shapes (A. Jacobson): Ch. 2
