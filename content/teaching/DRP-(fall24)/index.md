This project was on studying wavelets and their application to applied mathematics. Wavelets can be thought of as a generalization of the Fourier transform and Fourier series to a wider class of orthornomal families.
We studied the continous wavelet transform and how to use it to construct orthornomal bases. We then discussed some applications of the continous and discrete wavelet transform.
We used the following resources:
